# Blockstack App Generator [![CircleCI][circleci-image]][circleci-url] [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Slack][slack-image]][slack-url]

## Installation

1) Install Blockstack for desktop:

- [Releases](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser/releases)

2) Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and the blockstack app generator using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-blockstack
```

3) Create a new directory and `cd` into it:

```bash
mkdir hello-blockstack && cd $_
```

4) Generate your Blockstack app:

```bash
yo blockstack
```

---

*For Webpack*

```bash
yo blockstack:webpack
```

---

*For React.JS*

```bash
yo blockstack:react
```



---

*For Vue.JS*

```bash
yo blockstack:vue
```

---

5) Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Testing

*For all generators*


```bash
npm run test
```

This command will generate the four variants of Blockstack apps in folders called .app-gen-test,
.webpack-gen-test, .react-gen-test, and .vue-gen-test and assert that all expected files were
actually created. It also runs the `npm run test` command within each app. For the
React, Webpack, and Vue generators, `npm run test` currently builds the app, but that command can be
changed. (For a React app, the typical test command is `react-scripts test`.)
